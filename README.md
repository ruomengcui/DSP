R code for ``An Empirical Signal Processing Model of Supply Chains"

The master file is m.R: this file is a switchboard, which executes different aspects of my code. The file calls header.R, which initializes the project. You will have to modify the file path names in header.R to suit your environment. Note, the code in the "code/R/functions/" folder can be found at https://github.com/robertlbray/Rfuns.
